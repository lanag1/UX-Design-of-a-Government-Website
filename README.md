## DH150: Assignment Low-Fidelity Prototyping 
### Purpose
The main purpose of this test is to verify whether or not the features that I have created are helpful for and usable by the target users and demographocs.
### Persona
The user persona that I have identified can be categorized by the following: people with mild knowledge of technoloy. These people can be of any age or demographic as this is a government site and pretains to the entire population. For this low- fidelity test, I will be using one of my roomates who is veryskilled with technoloy and a 21 year old college student. 
### Features and Tasks
The features and tasks of this low-fidelity prototype were identified through multiple steps of my user research. This research includes the usability testing of existing website features, contextual inquiry of a target user, and other observations made by myself  based on my experience and understanding of the site and similar site for the California government. The three features include: the ability to make a Covid-19 vaccination appointment; using the search function; and getting information about a booster shot. I decided on these functions to test as they are likely the most widely used features of the site.
## Wireframes & Wireflows
All wireframes, wireflows, and testing pictures can be found [here:](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1btnLiGE_RqBMnWqMoa-oj2V3DMgZG4EXMgElf6MkiMA/edit#slide=id.p)
> In the images of the walkthrough of the test, I used pink ink to indicate major issues the user experienced and/or highly suggested. I then used blue to mark more minor or stylistic choices my user recommended. I also used orange ink to indicate which tab the user was on as well as arrows to indicate how one would move between tabs. 
### Notes on Wireflow Test
#### Test 1:
> Feedback: have an option on o=if you are guided to the calendar or home page. Good that both are an option and provide user with flexibility.
#### Test 2:
> Feedback: Make eligibility the main pop up not "Booster Shot Now available". Good that there is an option to guide you to make an appointment
#### Test 3:
> The search feature should be combined with the FAQ tab as both are essential but do not require their own features. The hyperlink to online articles is a good layout for the search function to follow.
## Summary
This assignment was very useful in not onlyputting all my ideas on paper but also gaining useful insight into the user's mind. When skethcing out all the frames, I truly realized how detailed UI/UX designs are as ech and ever action requires a visual component as well. Sketching out all these components as very useful. What proved to be the most useful was walking my user through these components and features of the app and getting their feedback in real time. By conducting the tests with various features, I was able to gain insight into how the average users would navigate through the app with no experience and minimal assistance. This is very valuable research as it shows us how a user would interact with the app in the real world.
